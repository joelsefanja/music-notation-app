# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Music Converter Optimization project builds upon the existing music notation converter to introduce significant improvements in performance, flexibility, and user experience. This enhancement focuses on refining the Canonical Song Data Model to explicitly support empty lines, optimizing the parsing and rendering engines, implementing advanced UI animations, and expanding test coverage. The goal is to create a more robust, flexible, and user-friendly application that handles all nuances of different notation formats while maintaining optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a refined Canonical Song Data Model that explicitly supports empty lines and complex annotations, so that all nuances of different notation formats can be accurately captured and converted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes input with empty lines THEN it SHALL create EmptyLine objects with optional count for consecutive empty lines
2. WHEN the system encounters annotations that span entire lines THEN it SHALL create AnnotationLine objects with proper type classification
3. WHEN the system processes chord placements THEN it SHALL store both originalText and canonical value with precise startIndex/endIndex positions
4. WHEN the system handles different line types THEN it SHALL use discriminated union types (TextLine, EmptyLine, AnnotationLine) for type safety
5. WHEN the system processes sections THEN it SHALL support all section types including 'note' for global comments and 'unknown' for unrecognized sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized core parsing engines that efficiently handle diverse input formats, so that the system can accurately parse complex notation with empty lines and annotations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the parser encounters consecutive newline characters with no content THEN it SHALL generate EmptyLine objects with accurate count
2. WHEN the parser identifies annotation patterns THEN it SHALL create AnnotationLine objects with proper annotationType classification
3. WHEN the parser processes chord placements THEN it SHALL populate originalText and precise startIndex/endIndex for inline chords
4. WHEN the parser encounters unexpected formats or syntax errors THEN it SHALL implement robust error recovery and log detailed error information
5. WHEN the parser processes Nashville Number System THEN it SHALL handle all rhythmic symbols (◆, ^, ., <, >) correctly
6. WHEN parsing fails partially THEN the system SHALL parse as much as possible and provide detailed error reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized core rendering engines that efficiently convert the canonical model to any output format, so that all format-specific requirements are met with proper handling of empty lines and annotations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering TextLine objects THEN the system SHALL display text and place chords appropriately (above or inline) based on output format
2. WHEN rendering EmptyLine objects THEN the system SHALL output the specified count of empty lines
3. WHEN rendering AnnotationLine objects THEN the system SHALL wrap the value in format-specific markup
4. WHEN rendering to the same input format THEN the system SHALL use originalText from ChordPlacement to preserve original formatting
5. WHEN rendering to different formats THEN the system SHALL use canonical chord values with proper format conversion
6. WHEN rendering sections THEN the system SHALL apply format-specific whitespace rules (e.g., three empty lines after comments in Songbook)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a musician, I want robust chord transposition logic that handles complex chords and Nashville Number System, so that all chord types can be accurately transposed while preserving their musical meaning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transposing complex chords THEN the system SHALL preserve all extensions, qualities, and bass notes accurately
2. WHEN converting from Nashville Number System THEN the system SHALL convert numbers to actual notes based on the song's key
3. WHEN converting to Nashville Number System THEN the system SHALL convert notes to numbers and qualities based on the song's key
4. WHEN transposing within Nashville Number System THEN the system SHALL shift numbers appropriately while preserving qualities and accidentals
5. WHEN processing rhythmic symbols in Nashville format THEN the system SHALL parse and render all symbols (◆, ^, ., <, >) correctly
6. WHEN transposition encounters unsupported chord types THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a seamless conversion engine that handles all format combinations, so that users can convert between any supported formats with consistent results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversion engine receives input THEN it SHALL automatically detect the format using the format detector
2. WHEN format detection is complete THEN the system SHALL parse the input to the canonical model using the appropriate parser
3. WHEN transposition is requested THEN the system SHALL apply key changes to the canonical model before rendering
4. WHEN rendering is requested THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate renderer to convert canonical model to target format
5. WHEN conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific failure details
6. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL maintain performance standards and provide progress feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimized UI components that handle the new data structures efficiently, so that the interface remains responsive and provides excellent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OutputPreview component renders content THEN it SHALL correctly interpret and display all Line types (TextLine, EmptyLine, AnnotationLine)
2. WHEN displaying chords THEN the system SHALL position them correctly (above or inline) based on the output format
3. WHEN rendering empty lines THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate amount of whitespace
4. WHEN showing annotations THEN the system SHALL apply proper formatting and styling
5. WHEN the UI updates THEN all components SHALL follow the established design system with consistent colors, typography, and spacing
6. WHEN the interface is used on different devices THEN it SHALL maintain responsiveness and usability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and performant animations that enhance the user experience, so that interactions feel polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the key is changed for transposition THEN chord elements SHALL animate smoothly to their new values
2. WHEN the output format is changed THEN the preview SHALL transition smoothly between different format displays
3. WHEN animations are playing THEN they SHALL not impact application performance or responsiveness
4. WHEN long operations are running THEN loading indicators SHALL provide clear feedback to users
5. WHEN animations complete THEN the final state SHALL be stable and accurate
6. WHEN multiple animations occur simultaneously THEN they SHALL be coordinated to avoid visual conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all parsing and rendering functionality, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN testing renderers THEN all output formats SHALL be verified for accuracy against expected results
3. WHEN testing the conversion engine THEN end-to-end conversion workflows SHALL be validated for all format combinations
4. WHEN testing UI components THEN responsiveness, animations, and user interactions SHALL be verified
5. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL achieve high code coverage and catch regressions effectively
