# UI Component Migration & Optimization Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan converts the UI component migration and optimization requirements into actionable development tasks that integrate with the SOLID architecture and achieve 100% test coverage.

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Complete UI Component Migration and SOLID Integration
  - Migrate all component tests from `src/components/__tests__/` to `tests/components/` with proper directory structure
  - Create React dependency injection hooks (useContainer, useChordFactory, useKeyTransposer, useEventManager, useStorageService)
  - Update all UI components to integrate with SOLID architecture services (ConversionEngine, ChordFactory, KeyTransposer, EventManager, StorageService)
  - Modernize all components to use functional components with hooks, proper TypeScript typing, error boundaries, and loading states
  - Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback throughout the UI
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [ ] 2. Implement Complete Dark Mode Theme System &  Complete Feature Integration and Optimization




  - Create comprehensive theme system with ThemeContext and ThemeProvider
  - Implement black (#000000) background and white (#FFFFFF) text for dark mode
  - Style all components (inputs, buttons, dropdowns, selectors) with dark theme support
  - Add theme toggle functionality with smooth transitions and persistence to localStorage
  - Ensure all existing components respect the theme context and work in both light and dark modes
  - Test theme switching behavior and visual consistency across all components
    - Implement and test chord conversion between all supported formats (ChordPro, OnSong, Nashville, Guitar Tabs, Songbook)
  - Complete key transposition functionality with enharmonic spelling suggestions and chord relationship analysis
  - Implement Nashville number system with Roman numeral support and scale degree analysis
  - Complete file import/export functionality with drag-and-drop support, validation, and error handling
  - Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes with mobile-friendly interactions and touch gesture support
  - Optimize performance with code splitting, lazy loading, memoization, and bundle size optimization
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7_


- [ ] 4. Implement Complete Storage System &  Achieve 100% Playwright Test Coverage
  - Implement automatic saving to local storage with debounced saving and save status indicators
  - Add session restoration capabilities with proper state hydration and storage format migration
  - Complete file export functionality supporting all target formats with proper naming and metadata
  - Complete file import functionality supporting all source formats with validation and drag-and-drop
  - Add comprehensive storage error handling with appropriate error messages, retry mechanisms, and quota management
    - Set up comprehensive Playwright test infrastructure with multiple browser support, test data, fixtures, and page object models
  - Create complete workflow tests covering chord conversion, key transposition, and file import/export workflows
  - Implement theme testing for both light and dark modes with theme switching behavior
  - Create responsive design tests across different viewport sizes, mobile interactions, and tablet/desktop layouts
  - Implement accessibility tests for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast compliance
  - Achieve 100% code coverage by testing all code paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
  - Implement visual regression testing with baseline screenshots and automated visual diff detection
  - Create comprehensive error scenario tests for network failures, invalid input handling, and storage failure recovery
  - Add performance benchmarks testing page load times, interaction response times, and memory usage
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_
