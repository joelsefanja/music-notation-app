# UI Component Migration & Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating UI component tests to the proper test structure, integrating components with the new SOLID architecture, implementing a dark mode theme, and achieving 100% test coverage with Playwright.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Structure Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI component tests to be properly organized in the tests directory, so that the test structure is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component tests are migrated THEN all tests from `src/components/__tests__/` SHALL be moved to `tests/components/`
2. WHEN tests are migrated THEN the test imports SHALL be updated to work with the new SOLID architecture
3. WHEN tests are migrated THEN all test files SHALL maintain their original functionality
4. WHEN tests are migrated THEN the old test directory SHALL be removed from src/components

### Requirement 2: SOLID Architecture Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI components to integrate seamlessly with the new SOLID architecture, so that the application uses consistent patterns and dependency injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL use the dependency injection container for services
2. WHEN components need chord processing THEN they SHALL use the ChordFactory and ChordBuilder
3. WHEN components need key transposition THEN they SHALL use the KeyTransposer service
4. WHEN components need event handling THEN they SHALL use the EventManager
5. WHEN components need storage THEN they SHALL use the StorageService

### Requirement 3: Dark Mode Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dark mode option with black and white styling, so that I can use the application comfortably in low-light environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the background SHALL be black (#000000)
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the text SHALL be white (#FFFFFF)
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN input fields SHALL have dark styling with white text
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN buttons SHALL have appropriate dark styling
5. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the theme SHALL be persistent across sessions
6. WHEN the user toggles theme THEN the change SHALL be immediate and smooth
7. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all components SHALL respect the dark theme

### Requirement 4: Complete Feature Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want all discussed features to be fully implemented and working, so that I have a complete music notation conversion experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN chord conversion SHALL work between all supported formats
2. WHEN using the application THEN key transposition SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN using the application THEN Nashville number conversion SHALL be functional
4. WHEN using the application THEN file import/export SHALL work properly
5. WHEN using the application THEN the UI SHALL be responsive and accessible
6. WHEN using the application THEN error handling SHALL be graceful and informative
7. WHEN using the application THEN performance SHALL be optimal for typical use cases

### Requirement 5: 100% Playwright Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive end-to-end test coverage with Playwright, so that all user interactions and workflows are thoroughly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL cover all UI components
2. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL cover all user workflows
3. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL test both light and dark modes
4. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL test responsive design
5. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL test accessibility features
6. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL achieve 100% code coverage
7. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL include visual regression testing
8. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL test error scenarios
9. WHEN Playwright tests are run THEN they SHALL test performance benchmarks

### Requirement 6: Component Modernization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all UI components to follow modern React patterns and best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL use React hooks instead of class components
2. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL implement proper TypeScript typing
3. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL use proper error boundaries
4. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL implement loading states
5. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance
6. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL follow accessibility guidelines

### Requirement 7: Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want local storage functionality to work seamlessly, so that my work is preserved between sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create or modify content THEN it SHALL be automatically saved to local storage
2. WHEN I reload the application THEN my previous work SHALL be restored
3. WHEN I export files THEN they SHALL be saved in the correct format
4. WHEN I import files THEN they SHALL be parsed correctly
5. WHEN storage operations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be shown
