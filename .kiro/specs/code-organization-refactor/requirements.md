# Code Organization Refactor Requirements

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing the current file structure in the music notation app to follow better naming conventions and folder organization best practices. The goal is to improve code maintainability, readability, and developer experience by creating a more intuitive and consistent file structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reorganize Parser Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parser files to be organized in a clear, logical structure with shorter, more descriptive names, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing parser files THEN the system SHALL create a cleaner folder structure under `src/parsers/`
2. WHEN renaming parser files THEN the system SHALL use shorter, more descriptive names (e.g., `ChordPro.ts` instead of `ChordProAnnotationParser.ts`)
3. WHEN organizing annotation parsers THEN the system SHALL group them in a dedicated `annotations/` folder
4. WHEN organizing core parsers THEN the system SHALL group them in a dedicated `core/` folder
5. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements to reflect the new paths

### Requirement 2: Reorganize Test Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be organized alongside their corresponding source files or in a mirror structure, so that I can easily find and maintain tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing test files THEN the system SHALL create a structure that mirrors the source code organization
2. WHEN naming test files THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `ChordPro.test.ts`)
3. WHEN organizing parser tests THEN the system SHALL group them under `src/parsers/__tests__/` or co-locate them with source files
4. WHEN moving test files THEN the system SHALL update all import paths in test files

### Requirement 3: Reorganize Types Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type definitions to be organized by domain and functionality, so that I can easily find and use the appropriate types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing type files THEN the system SHALL group related types together by domain
2. WHEN naming type files THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names without redundant suffixes (e.g., `chord.ts` instead of `chord.types.ts`)
3. WHEN organizing parser-related types THEN the system SHALL consider grouping them with parser code or in a dedicated types folder
4. WHEN moving type files THEN the system SHALL update all import statements throughout the codebase

### Requirement 4: Update Import Statements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import statements to be automatically updated when files are moved, so that the codebase continues to work without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving any file THEN the system SHALL update all import statements that reference the moved file
2. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL use relative paths where appropriate
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL maintain proper TypeScript module resolution
4. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure no broken imports remain

### Requirement 5: Maintain Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to maintain all existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL succeed without errors
4. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work as before

### Requirement 6: Follow Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new file organization to follow industry best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL follow common TypeScript/Node.js project conventions
2. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL use kebab-case for file names
3. WHEN organizing folders THEN the system SHALL group related functionality together
4. WHEN creating the structure THEN the system SHALL minimize nesting depth where possible
5. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL follow common testing conventions (co-location or mirrored structure)
