# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement core architecture with SOLID principles and design patterns





  - Set up foundational interfaces and enhanced type system with clear, descriptive names
  - Implement Dependency Injection container with constructor injection pattern
  - Refactor ChordService with Factory and Builder patterns (IChordFactory, ChordBuilder, fluent interface)
  - Implement KeyTransposer with Command pattern (ITransposeCommand, TransposeCommandManager, undo/redo functionality)
  - Implement NashvilleConverter with Builder pattern (INashvilleBuilder, NashvilleNotationDirector)
  - Refactor BaseParser with Template Method and Strategy patterns (IChordExtractionStrategy, IFormatValidator, ChordExtractionStrategyFactory)
  - Implement ErrorRecovery with Chain of Responsibility pattern (IErrorRecoveryHandler, ErrorRecoveryChainBuilder, concrete handlers)
  - Enhance ParserRegistry with improved Registry pattern (dynamic registration, parser validation)
  - Implement Storage with Adapter pattern (IStorageAdapter, FileSystemStorageAdapter, StorageService)
  - Implement Observer pattern for ConversionEngine (IEventManager, DomainEvent classes, event publishing)
  - Update ConversionEngine as proper Facade with dependency injection and comprehensive error handling
  - Fix all existing TypeScript compilation errors (ConversionError interface, missing imports, Line type issues)
  - Create domain-specific value objects (ChordRoot, NashvilleNumber) with proper validation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3_




- [ ] 2. Create comprehensive test suite and finalize refactoring
  - Create unit tests for all new pattern implementations (Factory, Builder, Command, Strategy, Chain of Responsibility, Adapter patterns)
  - Create integration tests for complete workflows (end-to-end conversion, error recovery scenarios, event publishing, dependency injection)
  - Create performance benchmarks (parsing performance, memory usage comparison, scalability testing)
  - Update code documentation with comprehensive JSDoc comments and design pattern documentation
  - Create migration guide for breaking changes and compatibility layer if needed
  - Validate all requirements are met (SOLID principles implementation, design patterns correctness, TypeScript error resolution)
  - Run complete test suite and verify coverage meets quality standards
  - _Requirements: All requirements - comprehensive testing, documentation, and final validation_
